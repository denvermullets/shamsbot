## ShamsBot

Simple Node.js app that uses Twitter's Streaming API to get new tweets and post to slack.

There's a limit of 25 options for the api (I just put individual accounts to follow), so feel free to change those.

This is really easy to modify for whatever you want, just change the variables and add in your own API Key for Slack / Twitter.

```
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN
TRADERS_SLACK=YOUR_SLACKBOT_TOKEN
```
